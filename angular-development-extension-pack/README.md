# Angular Extension Pack

Angular/Front-End Devleopment Extension Pack for Visual Studio Code.

It's goal is to give you all the extensions needed for development but skips everything that changes the looks of Visual Studio Code. 

That includes extensions for writing code, documentation, linting, collaboration or starting containers with your back-end.

I explicitly avoid adding angular snippets.
